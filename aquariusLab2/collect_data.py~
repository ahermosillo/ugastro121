    '''
    Collects and saves data from A and B port of pico sampler. Uses ugradio.pico.capture_data().

    Arguments:
    filename: (string) the name of file
    v: (string) volt_range same as pico.capture_data
    div: (int) Divide the 62.5 MHz sample clock by this number for sampling
    dual_mode: (bool) samples from both A and B. If False, samples only from A.
    nbloc: (int) number of blocks (each with nsample data points)
    nsamp: (int) number of samples. default is 16000
    
    Returns:
    Statement that data is saved to name of files
